 CI/CD Pipeline for Containerized Application Deployment

Description:
Developed and implemented a CI/CD pipeline to automate the development, build, packaging, containerization, and deployment process of an application using DevOps tools and best practices. The pipeline streamlines application delivery, ensuring seamless integration and continuous deployment in a Kubernetes-based environment.

Key Highlights:

Git Workflow Implementation:

>> Developers clone the GitHub repository, create feature branches, and commit code changes.
>> Pull requests are raised for code reviews, ensuring quality before merging into the dev branch.

Automated Build and Packaging:

>> Configured a Jenkins pipeline triggered by changes in the dev branch.
>> Automated the build process, generating application packages and containerizing them using a Dockerfile.

Custom Docker Image Creation:

>> Developed a Dockerfile to create a custom image for the application.
>> Integrated Jenkins to build and push the Docker image to DockerHub.

Kubernetes Deployment Automation:

>> Implemented deployment scripts in Jenkins to deploy the application in a Kubernetes cluster.
>> Used the previously built Docker image as the base image for the deployment, ensuring pods are created and the application is running.

DevOps Tools Utilized:

Source Control: Git, GitHub

CI/CD: Jenkins

Containerization: Docker, DockerHub

Orchestration: Kubernetes

Scripting: Shell scripting for deployment automation

Impact:

>> Achieved faster and more reliable deployments, reducing the time from code commit to production.
>> Ensured high availability and scalability of the application in a containerized Kubernetes environment.
